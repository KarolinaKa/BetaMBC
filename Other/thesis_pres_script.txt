###################### Slide 1 ######################

Good Afternoon, 
Thank you for coming today. 
My name is Karolina and I am here to talk about my thesis project on 'Model based clustering using a finite mixture of unimodal beta densities'.

###################### Slide 2 ######################

Let's begin with an introduction. 

###################### Slide 3 ######################

To understand the context of this project, we first need to understand DNA methylation.

You can think of DNA methylation as an extra layer of information found on the DNA. 

While your DNA dictates your "nature", DNA methylation reflects the effect of your environment, "nurture". 

DNA methylation occurs in areas of the DNA known as CpG sites. These are like docking stations on the DNA where methylation can occur. 

DNA methylation is measured using beta values which range from 0 to 1. With 0 indicating no methylation and 1 full methylation. 

###################### Slide 4 ######################

There are three common methylation patterns we will consider. 

Hypomethylation, i.e. low levels of methylation. 

###################### Slide 5 ######################

Hypermethylation, i.e. high levels of methylation. 

###################### Slide 6 ######################

Everything in between. 

###################### Slide 7 ######################

We know that levels of DNA methylation are associated with human disease. 

So our objective is to identify which CpG sites show different DNA methylation patterns between individuals with different disease status, i.e. sick or healthy. 

For example, we may discover that hypermethylation at aparticular CpG site is associated with a certain type of breastcancer.

The broad question of interest is, 
which CpG sites can be used as bio-markers to aid in quickerdiagnosis and the development of a tailored treatment plan?

###################### Slide 8 ######################

Let's move on to the state of the art approach. 

###################### Slide 9 ######################

The research body which usually collects DNA methylation data is known as EWAS. 

They carry out their screening on a site by site basis using univariate tests like the t-test. 

There are two main caveats. 
Multiple testing problems. 
And having to transform the beta values prior to analysis to meet the assumption of normality for the t-test. 

###################### Slide 10 ######################

Beta values are transformed using equation (1) to M values, which are normally distributed. 
In general this has the effect of:
Obscuring the hypo and hyper methylation patterns and 
limiting the intuitive interpretability of the results. 

###################### Slide 11 ######################

This slide shows the effect this transformation has on real DNA methylation data. 

In the left panel we have a histogram of raw beta values, 
and on the right are the same values, transformed.

###################### Slide 12 ###################### 

We had a brief look at the current screening approach. Now, let's move onto the proposed approach developed as part of this thesis. 

###################### Slide 13 ###################### 

Instead of carrying out site-by-site tests, we will use model based clustering. 

Our model is a finite mixture of 3 unimodal Beta densities of the standard form. 

We assign each CpG site into one of the 3 clusters reflecting the common methylation patterns we have seen in the previous slides and repeat this step for the number of patient groups/cohorts we are testing. 

We follow this by finding differences in cluster memberships between the cohorts. 

###################### Slide 14 ###################### 

Methods

###################### Slide 15 ######################

The beta distribution is the backbone of our approach. 
The beta distribution is a very versatile function used to model continuous variables with compact support defined on the interval S = [0, 1]. 

Its shape is governed by two parameters, alpha and beta. 

Our focus is on the subclass of unimodal beta densities. 

We reparametrise the function in terms of the mode, m and scale parameter, v related to the spread of the density around m. 

And you can think of m and v as analogous to mu and sigma2 in the Gaussian scenario. 

###################### Slide 16 ######################

This is how the reparametrised beta density looks like for different values of m. You can see our density has one peak only. 

###################### Slide 17 ######################

We began our work with the univariate case. This is the case where we have DNA methylation data of one individual. 

The EM algorithm was used to estimate the density parameters and cluster memberships. 

We arrive at the standard form of the complete data log likelihood for the incomplete data problem in the mixture setting. 

It is worth noting that no closed form solution for the M step exists so numerical optimisation was used at each iteration. 

###################### Slide 18 ######################

After coding up the algorithm for the univariate case, we began work on extending the algorithm to a multivariate scenario. This is the case where we have DNA methylation data of p individuals. 

No strictly multivariate generalisation of the Beta distribution.
Instead, we assume that conditional on their clustermembership, each CpG site exhibits a methylation patternindependent of the others.

The only difference in the complete log likelihoods is the addition of this summation term here which arises from multiplying p unimodal beta densities in the complete likelihood. 

The good news is that domain knowledge allows us to fix theta, thus surpassing the computationally demanding M-step. Generally, we fix the modes of the mixture to 0, 0.5 and 1 while keeping v constant at around 0.1.

###################### Slide 19 ######################

We tested our method on some real data and these are some preliminary results. 

###################### Slide 20 ######################

Real DNA methylation data was used for this analysis. Cohortâ€™s Aand B denote individuals diagnosed with different sub-types ofbreast cancer.
Out of the 20,303 CpG sites analysed, 15.8% were found tobelong to different clusters in cohorts A and B.

In the cross tabulation, it is worth looking at the off diagonal entries to spot the differently clustered CpG sites and where they lay in relation to one another. 

###################### Slide 21 ######################

For the most part the uncertainty is quite low and tails off around the maximum possible uncertainty of 0.67.

###################### Slide 22 ######################

For CpG sites found to be in different clusters between the two cohorts, the uncertainty is spread out more uniformly. 

This is to be expected, since in general only a small proportion of CpG sites are in fact different. 

We can use these uncertainties to rank the CpG sites in order of increasing uncertainty, leaving us with a list of CpG sites which are most likely to be different between the cohorts at the very top of the list. 

###################### Slide 23 ######################

The next and final plot shows one the CpG sites identified as having a different methylation pattern between the cohorts and a very low uncertainty
.

Cohort A is clearly hypermethylated at this CpG site while Cohort B has a uniform methylation pattern. 

###################### Slide 24 ######################

Next, we will look at how well the algorithm performs. 
For 112 variables and 20k CpG sites, it takes an average of 7 seconds to run. 
A 5 fold increase in variables increases run time by around 20 seconds. 
The average is based on 20 runs of the algorithm for each array. 

###################### Slide 25 ######################

We will finish off with a slide on conclusion and future work.

###################### Slide 26 ######################

To conclude we will examine the advantages and limitations of the proposed method. 

The obvious advantage is speed. 
No multiple testing corrections required.Interpretability - there is no transformation required.Flexibility. If we want to find other methylation patterns, we can easily extend or modify the number of mixture components.
However there are some limitations.Multimodal methylation patterns can be mis-classified.Sensitive to choice of mixture and initial clusters. Independence assumption may not hold when multiple CpG sitesare located on the same gene.

###################### Slide 27 ######################

While a lot of work has been done, there is still a long way to go. 

Some of the planned future work includes:

Introduce covariates to account for batch effects, age, gender etc.Test performance on larger arrays. Commonplace to probe>450,000 CpG sites per individual.Optimise and clean code.The write-up!
